Welcome! I'm a third-year PhD candidate at Yale University. I love solving puzzles and tackling complex, mind-bending problems. My current work is at the exciting intersection of machine learning and physics, where I focus on creating physically interpretable models of dynamical systems. I bring an interdisciplinary perspective, having worked and published in diverse fields such as quantum computing, cosmology, and gravitational wave physics. Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedInâ€”or challenge me to a game of chess!
